        <p class="introduction__msg">
          Hey there everyone, my name is David Nugent. I'm a developer based out of BC, Canada. At 
          the end of July 2021 I decided to take on a project to develop an app a day for 30 days.
        </p>
        <p class="introduction__msg">
          This was in-part inspired by Wes Bos' JS30 free course - which I would highly recommend for any 
          junior dev's, you can find it <a href="https://javascript30.com" class="emph-link">here</a>.
          In this course, the idea is to learn by building and to only use vanillaJS with no packages or frameworks.
          As an avid user of frameworks such as React I had some trepidation and looking at the course at a glance I
          wasn't too sure I would actually learn any new skills, so I decided to take it one step further by building upon
          the daily concepts and build something unique every day instead. Thus UniqueJS30 was born.
        </p>
        <p class="introduction__msg">
          Below, as well as videos and descriptions, you can find live demos and source code. The sites below were originally
          built for desktop viewing but I will make these designs adaptive at a later stage. If you enjoy the concept
          or any of the projects, feel free to connect with me directly <a href="mailto:info@davidnugent.me" class="emph-link">here</a>.
