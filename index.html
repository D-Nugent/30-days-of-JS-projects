        <p class="introduction__msg">
          Hey there everyone, my name is David Nugent. I'm a developer based out of BC, Canada. At 
          the end of July 2021 I decided to take on a project to develop an app a day for 30 days.
        </p>
        <p class="introduction__msg">
          This was in-part inspired by Wes Bos' JS30 free course - which I would highly recommend for any 
          junior dev's, you can find it <a href="https://javascript30.com" class="emph-link">here</a>.
          In this course, the idea is to learn by building and to only use vanillaJS with no packages or frameworks.
          As an avid user of frameworks such as React I had some trepidation and looking at the course at a glance I
          wasn't too sure I would actually learn any new skills, so I decided to take it one step further by building upon
          the daily concepts and build something unique every day instead. Thus UniqueJS30 was born.
        </p>
        <p class="introduction__msg">
          Below, as well as videos and descriptions, you can find live demos and source code. The sites below were originally
          built for desktop viewing but I will make these designs adaptive at a later stage. If you enjoy the concept
          or any of the projects, feel free to connect with me directly <a href="mailto:info@davidnugent.me" class="emph-link">here</a>.

              For day twelve I created a reimagining of the classic electric game of Simon Says, dubbed 'David Says'. The idea for this 
              game was inspired by Key Sequence Detection where user actions are logged and compared to a set criteria to illicit a specific response.
              I enjoyed exploring different methods for getting sequential audio clips to wait for one another, both creative use of an incremented 
              setTimeOut inside a forEach and also by using Async/Await and Promises. I got my hands dirty with some audio manipulation as well - all 
              of the voice-overs are actually me with the pitch edited.

              For day thirteen I explored the topic of Scroll Hijacking.Scroll hijacking gets a bad rep for being poor for user
              accessibility and for hampering the functionality of a site, while I agree to a degree I also believe if executed well
              they can also add emphasis to the point of a site/page if they don't take functionality away from a  user - this was
              one of the goals of this project. I enjoyed creating a debounce function to limit the number of event fires.

              For day fourteen, I created a game inspired by Tic-Tac-Toe dubbed Chick-Quack-Crow (I make zero apologies for the bad quality of this pun). 
              I had a lot of fun with the logic and creating a computer AI to play against you. I made the AI quite aggressive so it does play to win and 
              typically will win unless you play smart! It was also good managing the logic behind the game.

              For day fifteen, of my UniqueJS30DayChallenge I explored the use of localStorage to persist state/data across refreshes/re-navigation/tab close.
              To do this I applied logic to a timer app which tracks the current progress of a given task to a scope of a larger project. The logic behind the 
              scenes for this app was quite complex in parts. I created a complex factory function to give scope/control to the individual timers and improve 
              re-usability. I created a drift control for our timers to improve accuracy. I found a method for re-applying methods to the factory functions
              when restored from local storage. All of this was very fun and would encourage you to check out the code in the repo!

              For day sixteen,  I looked at a use-case for side-effects on Mouse Move. 
              Similarly to scroll hijacking I considered how the side-effects could be used
              to emphasize a point rather than detract from the usability. To demonstrate this idea I created
              an ad for VPN Awareness and made an effect where the characters eyes will follow your cursor as you
              move around the screen which is cool(or creepy).

              For day seventeen, I created a game (inspired in-part by some of the retro Final Fantasy games) where you explore a
               dungeon and get some random fight encounters. These encounters use a turn-based style of fighting. The main character
               and every monster have their own special attack with animations and sound effects as well. I explored some creative use
               of getBoundingClientRect() in order to map out blocked coordinates for where our character can move which allows greater
               flexibility and adds the ability to easily adjust maps. I created all of the sprites for the map and the attack 
               animations myself which was time-consuming but fun!

              For day eighteen, I decided to create a calculator app - ok that's a lie - I created a 🐄culator. This app has all of the
              typical tools of a scientific calculator and has the added benefit of being able to give you a visual representation of 
              your solutions in cow-form. I had particular fun with implementing a calculation history feature which allows you to step backwards
              and forwards through previous entries, reminding myself how to do school-level math (hey, it's beeen a while) and seeing how
              I could coerce these into a flexible function that could be handled by JavaScript.
